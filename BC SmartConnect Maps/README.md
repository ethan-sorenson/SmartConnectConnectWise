# SmartConnect Integrations
This folder contains all information needed to import and start running the integrations.

## Integration Documentation
Each integration is in a separate folder with a full README file containing documentation for the integration.
For example [/CUSTOMERS_01_CW_BC/README.md](./CUSTOMERS_01_CW_BC/README.md) contain the documentation for the CUSTOMERS_01 integration.

## Integration Files
The [_Integration Files](./_Integration%20Files/) folder contains the .zip files for all the integrations. You can choose which files you require for your project and only use the required files.

## Calculation Scripts
The [_Calculation Scripts](./_Calculation%20Scripts/) folder contains the script used by every calculation in the integrations. 

*Note: Some integrations share the same calculation script. When this happens it will only be referenced once in the folder.*
